Server training

Remember that the folder node_modules has not been comitted so you need to do a npm init to make it work

All the relevant code section that is not a generic part of the express generator setup, is found within 
the login.jade file in the views folder, and the javascript code added is found in the index.js file in the router folder !

kind regards Kristian Witt Bergqvist
